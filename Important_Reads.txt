Lots of folders have different .env variables.
Update as developmenet progress but at the moment:

nextjs/db-websocket
nextjs/login-auth-app

Both folders share the jwt private key in their .env files are are required for the full functionality.

When moving files from local to developmenet or vise versa permission of the folders and uid of the postgres
instances are VERY important.

use id postgres to get the UID of the postgres instance and configure using chown.
